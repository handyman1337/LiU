    "## **1. Reinforcement Learning, introduction**\n",
    "In the previous assignments we have explored supervised learning, in other words, methods that train a model based on known inputs and targets. This time, we will instead look at a branch of machine learning that is much closer to the intuitive notion of \"learning\". Reinforcement learning, or RL for short, does not work with inputs and targets, but instead learns by performing **actions** in an **environment** and observing the generated **rewards**.\n",
    "\n",
    "RL is a very broad concept and many different algorithms have been deviced based on these general concepts of actions and rewards. Perhaps the main advantage of RL over other machine learning techniques is that we do not explicitly tell the model what the right answer is (like we have done in the previous assignments), but instead only tell the model when the desired outcome has been acheived. This might seem like the same thing at first, but the key difference is that RL allows the model to device solutions that outperform the human teacher. This is usually not possible in traditional supervised learning since the model can only get as good as the training data (the teacher). With the freedom to explore new strategies, which is inherent to RL, this is no longer true and some truly astounding results have been acheved. The most famous example is probably AlphaGo, the first computer program to beat a human expert in the board game Go. [Here is an excellent documentary](https://youtu.be/WXuK6gekU1Y), if you have some time to spare. For those of you that want a quicker and more fun example, [here is a video about RL agents playing hide and seek](https://youtu.be/kopoLzvh5jY), which very clearly demonstrates the power of RL to invent new and hidden strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, these examples are from the very forefront of current research in RL, and are unfortunately too complex for this assignment. We will instead work on a much simpler problem, but the core concepts that you will implement and investigate here are the same that made the above possible."

    "## **2. Implementing the Q-learning algorithm**\n",
    "You will now implement the main algorithm of this assignment, **Q-learning**. This algorithm is powerful since it allows the simultaneous exploration of different **policies**. This is done by a state-action table **Q**, keeping track of the expected reward associated with each action in each state. By iteratively updating these estimates as we get new rewards, the policies explored by the agent eventually converges to the optimal policy. This can all be summarized in the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\large Q\\left(s_t,a\\right) \\leftarrow \\underbrace{Q\\left(s_t,a\\right)}_{\\mathrm{Old \\space value}} \\cdot \\left(1-\\alpha\\right) + \\alpha \\cdot \\underbrace{\\left(r + \\gamma V\\left(s_{t+1}\\right)\\right)}_{\\mathrm{New \\space estimate}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This defines that the value of $Q$ in a state $s_t$ for action $a$, i.e $Q\\left(s_t,a\\right)$, should be updated as a weighted average of the old value and a new estimate, where the weighting is based on the learning rate $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$. The new estimate is a combination of the reward $r$ for the action we are updating, and the estimated value $V$ of the next state $s_{t+1}$, discounted by the factor $\\gamma \\in (0,1]$. By increasing $\\gamma$, the future value is weighted higher, which is why we say that this optimizes for long-term rewards."

    "### 2.1 The training function\n",
    "First, you will implement the Q-learning algorithm training loop in the following function. The inputs to this function is a World object, and a dictionary for any parameters needed for the training. For example, this could be the learning rate, discount factor, number of training epochs, etc. You must decide what parameters you want to use and what to call them, but you must use this function signature. This is to make the code further down in the notebook run as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is created in python by a list of name-value pairs in curly brackets, for example `params = {\"Epochs\": 100, \"DiscountFactor\": 0.9}` and so on. You access the content of the dictionary by it's name, for example `params[\"DiscountFactor\"]`. Using this style makes it very easy later in the notebook to try new worlds and parameter combinations, and we therefore REQUIRE that you use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally before you begin, here are some concrete tips to keep in mind while working:\n",
    "* Try your code often! Jump ahead to section 3.1 to easily run the training in the first GridWorld.\n",
    "* When initializing the Q-table, it will be natural to use a 2D state space since that directly matches the grid structure of the GridWorlds. This means that when you add in the action dimension, the Q-table will be 3D. You can use the `getWorldSize` and `getActions` methods of the World class to get the correct sizes for each dimension. After this, it is trivial to index into the Q-table using the syntax `Q[state][action_index]`, where `action_index` is the index of the action in the list returned by `getActions()`. Our pre-provided draw functions also assumes this structure, so make sure to follow it.\n",
    "* Make sure you call the `draw` function of the world at regular intervals to see the training progress. For example after every 100th epoch.\n",
    "* It can be a good idea to implement a limit to the number of steps (actions) the agent is allowed to take before the epoch is reset, to prevent getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n",
    "* As part of this implementation, <span style=\"color:#ff6666\">you must also implement the functions</span> `getpolicy` and `getvalue` in `utils.py`. When you have implemented these the `draw` function will automatically show the results of the training!\n"

If you connect both the up-down and left-right edges, you get a mathematical shape called a torus which has no edges. This means that the closest path to the goal might not be obvious anymore.\n",

The goal of the Q-learner is to keep the rocket hovering as close to the center of the screen as possible (inside the marked square). The rocket can fire either it's left, right, or center thrusters, or none. The state space is continuous, meaning that the position, angle, velocity, and angular velocity of the rocket can take any value. To handle this within the current framework, the state space has been discretized, with more granular bins near the critical center position to allow for more precise control when close to the goal. This means that the final state space is now 6-dimensional, representing x and y position, x and y velocity, angle, and angular velocity.\n",
